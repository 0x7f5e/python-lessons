# Fibonnaci Sequence

# Difficulty: Advanced

# NOTE: This is *not* a practical example of how you'll use coding in your day to day, BUT it does appear on a surprising number of in-person coding interviews.  Why employers rely on something so impractical to gauge your coding ability is beyond me.
#       But since they're using it, maybe in this narrow sense it's a practical exercise to know how to do after all.


# The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ... The next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it.

# Create a program that will generate the first 10 numbers in the Fibonacci Sequence.

# When completed, your program should have the output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
